Currency Converter Android App Our currency converter is developed using flutter with no back end While developing this we use Different flutter widget some of that is discussed Below 1.A stateful widget is a widget that describes part of the user interface by building a constellation of other widgets that describe the user interface more concretely. 2. we use the function init state() to update the function synchronously 3. SafeArea widget A widget that insets its child by sufficient padding to avoid intrusions by the operating system. For example, this will indent the child by enough to avoid the status bar at the top of the screen. It will also indent the child by the amount necessary to avoid The Notch on the iPhone X, or other similar creative physical features of the display. 4.Scaffold widget Implements the basic Material Design visual layout structure. This class provides APIs for showing drawers and bottom sheets. To display a persistent bottom sheet, obtain the ScaffoldState for the current BuildContext via Scaffold.of and use the ScaffoldState.showBottomSheet function. 5.Column Widget A widget that displays its children in a vertical array. To cause a child to expand to fill the available vertical space, wrap the child in an Expanded widget. 6.Row Widget A widget that displays its children in a horizontal array. To cause a child to expand to fill the available horizontal space, wrap the child in an Expanded widget. The Row widget does not scroll (and in general it is considered an error to have more children in a Row than will fit in the available room). 7. container Widget A container first surrounds the child with padding (inflated by any borders present in the decoration) and then applies additional constraints to the padded extent (incorporating the width and height as constraints, if either is non-null). The container is then surrounded by additional empty space described from the margin. 8. Stack Widget The stack is a widget in Flutter. It contains a list of widgets and places them on top of each other. And it places their children on top of each other like a stack of books. In other words, stack developers would overlap multiple widgets on one screen. As you can add different images or colors using containers in it. 9.Expanded Widget A widget that expands a child of a Row, Column, or Flex so that the child fills the available space. 10.TextField Widget TextField in Flutter is the most commonly used text input widget that allows users to collect inputs from the keyboard into an app. We can use the TextField widget in building forms, sending messages, creating search experiences, and many more. By default, Flutter decorated the TextField with an underline. 11.DropdownMenuItem Widget An item in a menu created by a DropdownButton.
The type T is the type of the value the entry represents. All the entries in a given menu must represent values with consistent types. FUNCTION THAT IS IMPLEMENTED IN CURRENCY CONVERTR
